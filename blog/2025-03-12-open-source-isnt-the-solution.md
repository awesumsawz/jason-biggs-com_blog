Open source isn’t the magic fix for big tech’s bloat and indifference.

I love open source. I use it all the time. But let’s be honest—it’s not going to break big tech’s grip on the industry.

The reality is, massive companies rely on open source but rarely give back in a meaningful way. There are exceptions, but for the most part, if something isn’t driving profit, it’s not a priority. If these companies contributed even a fraction of the value they extract, we’d be in a different place. But that’s not how it works.

So what’s the alternative? More small, independent software companies. Tools that offer a free tier to help people get started, but with pricing that makes sense—because jumping from $0 to $200/month is a nonstarter for most people.

We need more developers building the tools they want to see in the world—and we need users who see value in those tools to pay for them. That’s how we create a healthier, more sustainable ecosystem.
