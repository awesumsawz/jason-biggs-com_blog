Amazon AWS has hands down the worst web UI/UX I’ve ever dealt with.

It’s a mess—clunky, confusing, and somehow always out of date. Every time I try to look something up, the documentation feels like it’s from a past era. Navigating the console is like solving a puzzle you didn’t sign up for.

Now, to be fair, AWS as a product is incredible. The sheer power and flexibility it offers are unmatched. And weirdly enough, the CLI? Fantastic. But the web UI? A disaster.

From what I can tell, this has been an issue for quite some time. How is this still the state of things in 2025?
