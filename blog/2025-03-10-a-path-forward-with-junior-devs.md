The job market for junior developers is dying because companies prioritize short term gain over long term viability. Who will take over when your seniors move on to another company or retire? The shrinking pool of fresh talent WILL bankrupt tech companies of all sizes. 

How do we solve it? If companies wonâ€™t listen to what developers know is true, we need to build our own stuff and bring in juniors to help. Turn your side projects into actual business and bring in juniors to maintain. Teach them what you know and encourage them to go build cool stuff too.
