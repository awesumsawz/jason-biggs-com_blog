Big tech is dying and we need a small tech boom. 

When the dot com rush started, masses of developers and creatives flocked to the new medium to create cool stuff. Companies grew out of this boom and blossomed into some of the largest companies we know today. 

But the tide has turned. Big tech is bloated and slow. Consolidation of resources and talent into these slow moving behemoths is nuking the outlook of tech as a whole. 

How do we fix it? The most talented developers and creatives in the industry need to abandon big tech and develop their own ideas into small businesses with the goal of creating something new and cool rather than a goal to be acquired.
