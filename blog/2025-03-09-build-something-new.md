If you’re job searching right now, I urge you to consider taking the time to build something new!

Layoffs are tough—I’ve been there before, and I know I’ll be there again. But if you have the flexibility, this could be a great time to explore something that excites you.

Maybe it’s launching a small business, contributing to open-source projects, or finally tackling that passion project you’ve been putting off. Not only does it sharpen your skills, but it can also open unexpected doors.

The reality is that many big companies prioritize shareholders over employees. Instead of jumping straight into another Fortune 500 role that may not value you, take a moment to invest in yourself.

Right now, I’m working on my own small business—building solutions that make my life easier (and might help others too). If you’ve got an idea you’re excited about, run with it! Opportunities like this don’t come often.

And if your idea needs a cloud engineer or software developer, let’s chat—I’d love to collaborate on something great!
