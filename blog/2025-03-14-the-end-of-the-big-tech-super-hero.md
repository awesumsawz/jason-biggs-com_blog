Big tech isn’t coming to save the day. 

Given a choice between conserving profit for shareholders or helping their employees through an economic downturn, which do you think the fortune 500s will choose?

This is your wake up call. 

Start taking your side projects more seriously. Start thinking about how you’d make your side hustle into a real business. Then, when the layoffs start, you can hit the ground running rather than falling flat on your face. 

Be prepared and work with your community. Work together. Trade services. Prioritize relationships over profit. 

The way we get through this is together.
